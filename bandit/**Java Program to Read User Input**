 **Java Program to Read User Input**

**Introduction:**
This Java program demonstrates how to read user input from the console. It uses the `Scanner` class to read an integer, a double, and a string from the user. The program then prints the values entered by the user.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Importing the Scanner Class:**
   ```java
   import java.util.Scanner;
   ```
   This line imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the console.

2. **Defining the `main` Method:**
   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   ```
   This is the main method of the program. It is the entry point of the program and is executed when the program is run.

3. **Creating a Scanner Object:**
   ```java
   Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
   ```
   This line creates a `Scanner` object named `scan`. This object will be used to read input from the console.

4. **Reading an Integer:**
   ```java
   int i = scan.nextInt();
   ```
   This line reads an integer from the console and stores it in the variable `i`. The `nextInt()` method of the `Scanner` class is used to read an integer.

5. **Reading a Double:**
   ```java
   double d = scan.nextDouble();
   ```
   This line reads a double from the console and stores it in the variable `d`. The `nextDouble()` method of the `Scanner` class is used to read a double.

6. **Reading a String:**
   ```java
   String s = scan.nextLine();
   ```
   This line reads a string from the console and stores it in the variable `s`. The `nextLine()` method of the `Scanner` class is used to read a string.

7. **Printing the Input:**
   ```java
   System.out.println("String: " + s);
   System.out.println("Double: " + d);
   System.out.println("Int: " + i);
   ```
   These lines print the values entered by the user to the console.

8. **Closing the Scanner Object:**
   ```java
   scan.close();
